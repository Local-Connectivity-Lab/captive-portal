                        Accordingly, you agree that the Seattle Community Network

                        The Seattle Community Network is not a charity project

                        collaborative and community-minded way. 
                        Since the network infrastructure is built, managed, 
                        and used by local communities, thus the slow turnaround 
                        time in troubleshooting should be expected.
